# Automate mysql secure installation for debian-baed systems
# 
#  - You can set a password for root accounts.
#  - You can remove root accounts that are accessible from outside the local host.
#  - You can remove anonymous-user accounts.
#  - You can remove the test database (which by default can be accessed by all users, even anonymous users), 
#    and privileges that permit anyone to access databases with names that start with test_. 
#  For details see documentation: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-secure-installation.html
